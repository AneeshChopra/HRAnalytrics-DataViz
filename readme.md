# Diamonds Data Exploration

## Dataset

One of the crucial roles of the HR Dept is to minimize the employee attrition rate i.e. preventing the reduction of staff(voluntary resigning or laid off by the company). If the HR dept is unable to do so,
The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners
A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company
A large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market.
The management of the company has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.
Playing the role of a Lead Data Analyst in the firm, this project has been assigned to me. Join me as I tread on this journey of exploration and attempt to figure out the main causes behind the attrition rate of company XYZ.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that 
The attrition rate of the company XYZ (17.78%) is very high considering the ideal attrition rate is 10% and it is also significantly higher than the global average of 11.2%.

We can see a dip in the age distibution as we move onto employees of greater age when looking at Ex-Employees with respect to the overall comapany. Hence, let's further look into the demographics
The claims of the newspapers seem to be very untrue in this case as the average of companies worked at increases gradually as the Generation gets older

Also, We can see that the employees who have left the company within the last 1 year were exposed to the work culture of many other companies across all age distributions. Perhaps they might not like the work culture here. Lets try to understand why.

Even though the HR department is smallest part of the company, nearly 30% of it's department has left in the previous year. This is ironic given that the HR department itself is responsible for maintaining and assessing the attrition rate. The HR department is also responsible of maintaining the work culture of the company in many case

We can see that across all departments, employees who have left have had lesser income as compared to the rest in their department and also Human resources has the least average income which can also be contributing to such a high rate of attrition in the department

the Employees have the same Manager for years and years on, their Job Satisfaction gradually decreases. This follows the same trend for those who left at a greater scale

## Key Insights for Presentation

Conclusions
Major Changes Have to be Made in the HR Department.
Wages to be increased for the HR department
Employees should not be working under the same manager for more than 4 years given that he/she is not being promoted
Employees who have worked at lesser companies should be preferred while hiring regardless of age
Focus on keeping the young population satisfied since the willingness to leave the company decreases with age
